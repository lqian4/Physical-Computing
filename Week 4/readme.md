# Love O Meter & Color Mixing Lamp
### After last week's basic LED circuit, I followed the tutorials on the book to make these two interesting Arduino projects. 
### The first one called Love O meter is to use the temprature sensor to detect the temperature of the surrounding environment to change the brightness of the LED. 
### The second one called Color Mixing Lamp is to use a tri-color LED and three photoresistors to create a lamp that smotthly changes colors depending on external lighting conditions. 
### In all, building this two projects gave me a whole understanding of how basic Arduino circuits work and how to improvise during different conditions.
