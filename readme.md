##Crazy Machine Idea
####For the crazy machine idea, I have been thinking about a machine that can make food automatically. There is one input where you put in all the raw material for the food. There is also a screen built on the screen for the user to choose from which dish they want the machine to make. There is also one outlet place where the dish is served.
