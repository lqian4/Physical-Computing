# Week 1 Assignment
## Crazy Machine Idea
#### For the crazy machine idea, I have been thinking about a machine that can make food automatically. There is one input where you put in all the raw material for the food. There is also a screen built on the screen for the user to choose from which dish they want the machine to make. There is also one outlet place where the dish is served.
###### The first step of the machine is for the users to select what kind of dish they want to have and the screen will show what kind of raw material they will need to prepare.
###### The second step is for the user to put all the raw materials they have prepared into the machine according to their different categories such as liquid item, meat, vegetables and spices.
###### Then the machine will showcase a list of items it have received and after the user have confirmed the dish they want, the cooking process will then begin automatically.
###### The last step of the machine is to wait until the machine finish the dish and the machine will output the dish in the specialize designed container ready to eat.
