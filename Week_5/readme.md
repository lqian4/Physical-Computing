# Digital Hour Glass
##### Originally from the tutorial book, this is a digital hour glass made by Arduino circuit that turns on an LED every ten minutes. And by making minor changes to my code, I can manage how often the LED turns on. 
##### The importance of this project is that it gives me a great sense of how I am gonna acheive my midterm project since my idea is to build a sound-level indicator and my core part of the project is to use the numbers of LED turns on and off to show the change of the sound level.
