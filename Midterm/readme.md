#Sound level meter

##For the midterm project of the physical computing class, I am making the sound level meter that can visualize the changing of the sound level with. The reason why I am making this game is because for my final project, I am thinking of making of a voice controlled 2D platformer game with Arduino so I thought it would be a good idea to start with some kind of voice controlled.

##The parts I chose for my project includes the Arduino packet as well as the MAX9814 microphone amplifier.The major obstacle I have encountered during creating my project is to wire up the microphone amplifier since I have never touched upon on how to use parts like this. I have looked up different kinds of similar microphonw amplifier online but was not able to find a proper instruction on how to wire up the MAX9814 one since this one has five outlets for the user to acheive different goals. In the end with the hope of my instructor Zeven, I was able to wire up the microphone and test it with a sample code to see if the data I received is responsive to the surrounding voice.

##After making sure the microphone works, it comes to the easy part which is to wire up the LEDs with the resistors to measure different level of sound. And then I wrote the code with several if statements about different voice levels corresponding to the lighting of different leds so the changing of voice level can be seen.
